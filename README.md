Problem 3 : My coding interview question is to write isSubstring(). I'm generous with hints and partial solutions, and I have a pass rate of about 15%. This isn't a hard question. It's something that any smart CS graduate should be able to bang out in a few minutes. And yet I routinely encounter working programmers who can't solve it in 45 minutes.
